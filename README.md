## Description

This is a responsive website intended to merge two of my favorite pursuits - coding and homebrewing! It features a host of content surrounding my misadventures in homebrewing beer. The website is built using entirely using HTML, CSS, and JS. The intent of this project was to practice and solidify my HTML and CSS skills. JS is used in certain instances, such as the slideshow in the title section and in nav menu. This website was built to be responsive so that it can be viewed on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Future additions to this project will be:

- Generation of certain content from JSON file
- Inclusion of new sections, including a social media feed, beer library, event history, contact form

## Installation

This site does not require any installation beyond downloading the files and opening the index.html file. This live site can also be visited [here!](https://johngardiner93.github.io/helsgardin-website/index.html)

## Usage

The website can be viewed on most browsers (mobile, tablet, and desktop). Scrolling down the site will reveal a nav menu that can be used to navigate the site. When on a mobile device, the menu will become a "hamburger" menu. The contents of the site will adjust to accomodate smaller screen sizes.
